# TOP-rock-paper-scissors
Basic rock paper scissors game with UI. All elements are created with DOM instead of HTML source code. When one of the buttons are clicked you are going against the computer and the webpages displays in text if you won or lost the round + if you win/lose the entire match. Call of duty black ops 2 audio was added for fun. 

NOTE: no styles were added since i wanted to focus only on javascript DOM.
